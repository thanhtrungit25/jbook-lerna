# JBook

This is an interactive coding environment. You can write Javascript, see it executed, and write comprehensive documentation using markdown.

- Click any text cell to edit it
- The code in each editor is all joined together into one file. If you define a variable in cell #1, you can reference it in any following cell.
- You can show any React component, string, number, or anything else by calling the `show `function. This is a function built into this environment

  All of your change get saved to the file you opened JBook with. So if you ran `npx jsnote-tdg serve test.js ` . All of text and code you write will be saved into `test.js` file
